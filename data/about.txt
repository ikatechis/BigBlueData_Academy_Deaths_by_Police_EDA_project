Dataset - Description
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Innocent Deaths caused by Police (All time).csv - 
"This dataset was created by Fatal Encounters. 
This dataset contains incidents in which an individual meets death during an encounter with law enforcement officials. 
The majority of encounters occur as a result of police homicide, 
as when officers shoot a person who is presenting a lethal threat to them or others. 
However, there are other types of Encounters that do not involve acts of police homicide, 
but in which police are otherwise involved or are present. 
Examples include a vehicle crash during a police chase or a suicide in a barricade situation."
